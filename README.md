YelpCamp code-along app to Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021" found on Udemy.
I have updated some styles from Bootstrap 5 alpha version (used in the course) to the current stable version.
The app is built on an express stack and is a small partial clone of Yelp. It has full CRUD functionality as well as data persistence, login functionality and a cluster map using the Mapbox API.
